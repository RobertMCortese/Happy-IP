# Happy-IP
A simple POSH Port Scanner

Long Story Short.

At work we were using Happy-IP to scan for free IP addresses (Yes I know, we should keep it better documented) but our ISSO's deemed it "No longer allowed!"  We could use NMAP, or even the Zenmap GUI, but it lacks easy export to CSV and is sort of a hammer to a fly.  So I wrote Happy-Ip

# Features:

* Fairly simple UI
* Can copy/paste from the gridview into excel
* Easy to read code makes it easy to test for other protocols.
